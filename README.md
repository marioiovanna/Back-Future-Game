```javascript
        // math for life player, add extra hit points
                players[playerValue].life -= players[vsValue].hitp;
                $('.lifeplayer').html('LIFE: ' + players[playerValue].life);
                players[playerValue].hitp += Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);
                console.log('player ' + players[playerValue].hitp);

        // math for vs player, add extra hit p
                players[vsValue].life -= players[playerValue].hitp;
                $('.lifevs').html('LIFE: ' + players[vsValue].life);
                players[vsValue].hitp += Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) + 1);
```
 This number will be random between 0 and 10, so it makes it fun, because you never know which player can defeat all of them. 
 **IT's LUCKY**
